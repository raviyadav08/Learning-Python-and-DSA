### Exercise: Python Variables
# 1. Create a variable called break and assign it a value 5. 
# See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see.

#break is used to break out of loop and its a keyword in python cannot be used to store value in it.
# break = 5
# print(break)
'''
2. Create two variables. 
One to store your birth year and another one to store current year. 
Now calculate your age using these two variables
'''
birthyear = 2001
currentyear= 2023
print(f'My current age is : {currentyear - birthyear}')


# 3. Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables 
# and then print your full name using these variables

fname = 'Ravi'
mname = 'Manohar'
lname = 'Yadav'
print(f'My name is {fname} {mname} {lname}')

#4 . Which of these are invalud variable names:
_nation = 1
# 1record = 2
record1 = 3
record_one =4
# record-one =5
# record^one =6
# continue

'''
